# TokenTest42 Project - Technical Documentation

## Project Overview

TokenTest42 is an ERC20 token with enhanced security features, specifically a multi-signature mechanism for large transfers.

## Technical Choices

### Development Framework: Hardhat


- **TypeScript Support**: Hardhat has native TypeScript support, allowing us to benefit from type safety and better IDE integration.
- **Comprehensive Tooling**: Hardhat provides a complete environment for Ethereum development with built-in testing, debugging, and deployment tools.
- **Task Automation**: Custom tasks and scripts streamline deployment and verification processes.
- **Mature Community**: Well-established community support and documentation.

### Smart Contract Libraries: OpenZeppelin


- **ERC20 Implementation**: Rather than writing an ERC20 token from scratch, we extended OpenZeppelin's audited implementation for security and standard compliance.
- **Ownership Management**: We used OpenZeppelin's Ownable pattern to handle administrative control securely.
- **Security Best Practices**: OpenZeppelin contracts follow industry security standards and have undergone multiple audits.
- **Reliability**: These contracts have been battle-tested in production environments, reducing the risk of vulnerabilities.

### Blockchain Network: BSC Testnet

We deployed to Binance Smart Chain Testnet for these reasons:

- **Lower Transaction Costs**: BSC offers lower gas fees compared to Ethereum mainnet, making testing more cost-effective.
- **Compatibility**: Full EVM compatibility ensures our contracts work the same as they would on Ethereum.
- **Easy Verification**: BSCScan provides tools for contract verification similar to Etherscan.
- **Faster Block Times**: Quicker confirmation times improve the testing experience.

### Multi-Signature Implementation

For our custom multi-signature system, we made these design decisions:

- **Integrated Approach**: We built the multisig directly into the token contract rather than using a separate wallet, streamlining the user experience.
- **Threshold-Based Activation**: The multisig is only required for transfers exceeding 100,000 tokens, balancing security and usability.
- **2-of-3 Requirement**: We require 2 out of 3 designated owners to approve large transfers, providing security without excessive coordination.

### Security Considerations

Security was a primary focus in our development process:

- **Nonce-Based Approvals**: Each approval has a unique identifier to prevent double-spending.
- **Permission Controls**: Owner verification ensures only authorized addresses can approve transfers.
- **Event Logging**: Comprehensive event emissions for tracking approval requests and confirmations.
- **Used Flag**: Approvals are marked as used after execution to prevent reuse.
